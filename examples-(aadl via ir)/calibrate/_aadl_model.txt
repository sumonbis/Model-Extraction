Here is an example of an AADL model that describes the given architecture description:

```aadl
package Timeout_System
public
   with Data_Model;

   system Timeout_System
      features
         Gpt_Response: out event port;
      properties
         SEI::Dispatch_Protocol => (SEI::Hybrid);
      end Timeout_System;

      system implementation Timeout_System.Impl
         subcomponents
            Timer: timer;
         connections
            Response_Connection: event data port Timeout_System.Gpt_Response -> Timer.Timeout;
         properties
            Response_Connection.QS => (data_port);
            Timer.Period => 5.0;
      end Timeout_System.Impl;

   end Timeout_System;

   thread timer
      features
         Timeout: out event data port;
      properties
         SEI::Thread_Implementation => (SEI::POSIX);
      end timer;

      thread implementation timer.Impl
         subcomponents
            Timeout_Timer: timer;
         properties
            Timeout_Timer.Period => 300.0;
            Timeout_Timer.QS => (queue);
      end timer.Impl;

end Timeout_System;

```

In this model, we have a system called Timeout_System, which has an event data port called Gpt_Response for receiving responses from the GPT (General Purpose Timer). The system has an implementation called Timeout_System.Impl.

The Timeout_System.Impl implementation has a subcomponent called Timer, which is a timer thread. The Timeout_System.Impl implementation also has a connection called Response_Connection, which connects the Gpt_Response event data port of the system to the Timeout event data port of the Timer thread. This connection ensures that the Timer thread is notified whenever a new response is received from the GPT.

The Timer thread is implemented by the timer.Impl thread implementation. It has a subcomponent called Timeout_Timer, which is a timer that generates a Timeout event after 5 minutes (300 seconds). The Timeout_Timer has a period property set to 300.0 to specify the 5-minute timeout period. The Timeout_Timer also has a QS property set to "queue" to indicate that it has a queue for handling multiple Timeout events.

This AADL model represents a simple architecture where a Timeout event is generated if no response is received from the GPT for 5 minutes. The Timeout event can be used to trigger appropriate actions or notifications in the system.
