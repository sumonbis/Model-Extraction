The UML architecture for the given drone application code can be described as follows:

1. Main class:
   - The main class is responsible for initializing the MAVSDK library, connecting to the drone system, discovering the camera, and executing the required camera operations.
   - This class interacts with the MAVSDK library and the Camera and Telemetry plugins.

2. MAVSDK library:
   - The MAVSDK library is responsible for connecting to the drone and providing various plugins for communication and control.
   - This library acts as an interface for accessing the drone system and its components.

3. Camera plugin:
   - The Camera plugin is responsible for interacting with the camera of the drone, such as switching to photo mode, taking a photo, and capturing photo information.
   - This plugin communicates with the Drone system to execute camera operations.

4. Telemetry plugin:
   - The Telemetry plugin is responsible for providing real-time telemetry information about the drone, such as position, altitude, and battery status.
   - This plugin communicates with the Drone system to retrieve telemetry data.

5. System:
   - The System represents the drone system and its components.
   - It is responsible for maintaining the connection with the drone and providing access to its plugins.

6. CaptureInfo:
   - The CaptureInfo class represents information about a captured photo, such as the file URL where it is stored.
   - It is used to pass captured photo information from the Camera plugin to the main class for display.

7. Future and Promise:
   - The Future and Promise classes are used for asynchronous communication and synchronization between threads.
   - They are used to wait for the discovery of a system with a camera and obtain the discovered system asynchronously.

8. sleep_for():
   - The sleep_for() function is used to pause the execution of the program for a specified duration.
   - It is used to introduce a delay before displaying the captured photo information.

9. Console I/O:
   - The code uses console I/O to display error messages, usage instructions, and information about the captured photo.

Note: The UML architecture does not show the standard C++ libraries included in the code.
