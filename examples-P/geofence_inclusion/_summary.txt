State Machine Description:
States:
1. Waiting to discover system
2. Discovered autopilot
3. System ready
4. Creating and uploading geofence

Events:
1. New system discovered
2. System health all ok

Transitions:
1. Start: Initial state
   Event: New system discovered
   Actions: Check if the discovered system has an autopilot
   Next state: Discovered autopilot

2. Start: Discovered autopilot
   Event: None
   Actions: Unsubscribe from new system discovery, set the discovered system as the target system
   Next state: System ready
   
3. Start: System ready
   Event: None
   Actions: None
   Next state: Creating and uploading geofence
   
4. Start: Creating and uploading geofence
   Event: None
   Actions: Create a geofence with predefined points and upload it to the system
   Next state: End
