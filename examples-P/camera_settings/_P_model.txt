Here's the translation of the given C code to P language, incorporating a state machine description for the timeout scenario:

```
// P language code

machine TimeoutMachine {
    states {
        Idle,
        WaitForResponse
    }

    transitions {
        Idle -> WaitForResponse : startTimeout
        WaitForResponse -> Idle : responseReceived
    }

    actions {
        timeoutAction
    }

    startstate Idle {
        on entry {
            // Start the timeout timer when entering the Idle state
            startTimeout();
        }
    }

    state WaitForResponse {
        on timer(TIMEOUT) {
            // No response received within the specified time
            // execute timeout action
            timeoutAction();
        }

        on exit {
            // Stop the timer when exiting the WaitForResponse state
            stopTimer(TIMEOUT);
        }
    }
}
```

Note that the P language is a modeling language that supports high-level descriptions of concurrent, event-driven systems, including state machines. The code provided above represents a timeout scenario using a state machine description, where the `TimeoutMachine` has two states (`Idle` and `WaitForResponse`) and two transitions (`Idle` to `WaitForResponse` and `WaitForResponse` to `Idle`). The `startTimeout` function is called when entering the `Idle` state, and the `timeoutAction` function is executed when the timer reaches the specified timeout value (5 minutes). The timer is stopped when exiting the `WaitForResponse` state.
