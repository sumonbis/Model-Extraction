The state machine for this code can be defined as follows:

States:
- Idle: The system is waiting for a command to be executed.
- Testing: The system is performing tests on the gimbal device.

Events:
- StartTest: Indicates that the gimbal device testing should be started.
- StopTest: Indicates that the gimbal device testing should be stopped.

Transitions:
- Idle -> Testing: Triggered by the StartTest event.
- Testing -> Idle: Triggered by the StopTest event.

C code representation of the state machine:

```c
typedef enum {
    STATE_IDLE,
    STATE_TESTING
} State;

typedef enum {
    EVENT_START_TEST,
    EVENT_STOP_TEST
} Event;

State current_state = STATE_IDLE;

void handle_event(Event event)
{
    switch (current_state) {
        case STATE_IDLE:
            if (event == EVENT_START_TEST) {
                current_state = STATE_TESTING;
                start_gimbal_testing();
            }
            break;
        case STATE_TESTING:
            if (event == EVENT_STOP_TEST) {
                current_state = STATE_IDLE;
                stop_gimbal_testing();
            }
            break;
    }
}
```
Note: You'll need to implement the `start_gimbal_testing` and `stop_gimbal_testing` functions according to your requirements.
