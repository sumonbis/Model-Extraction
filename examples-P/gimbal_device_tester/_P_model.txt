The equivalent P code representation of the state machine is as follows:

```p
type State = enum { Idle, Testing }
type Event = enum { StartTest, StopTest }

var current_state: State = Idle

procedure handle_event(event: Event)
begin
    if current_state == Idle and event == StartTest then
        current_state := Testing
        start_gimbal_testing()
    else if current_state == Testing and event == StopTest then
        current_state := Idle
        stop_gimbal_testing()
    end
end
```

Please note that the `start_gimbal_testing` and `stop_gimbal_testing` procedures need to be implemented separately according to your specific requirements.
