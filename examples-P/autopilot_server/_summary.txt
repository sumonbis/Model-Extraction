This source code implements a state machine that runs the MAVSDK server plugins on a separate thread and uses the main thread as a ground station. The state machine manages the following states and events:

States:
1. GroundStation: Represents the ground station state where the main thread is running as a GCS.
2. Autopilot: Represents the state where the MAVSDK server plugins are running on a separate thread.

Events:
1. ConnectionSuccess: Indicates that a connection between the ground station and the autopilot has been established.
2. ConnectionTimeout: Indicates that a connection between the ground station and the autopilot could not be established within a given timeout.
3. NewSystemDiscovered: Indicates that a new system (autopilot) has been discovered.
4. TakeoffSuccess: Indicates that the vehicle has successfully taken off.

Transitions:
1. GroundStation -> ConnectionSuccess -> Autopilot: Transition from the GroundStation state to the Autopilot state when a connection with the autopilot is successfully established.
2. GroundStation -> ConnectionTimeout -> GroundStation: Transition from the GroundStation state back to itself when a connection with the autopilot could not be established within a timeout.
3. Autopilot -> NewSystemDiscovered -> Autopilot: Transition from the Autopilot state back to itself when a new system (autopilot) is discovered.
4. Autopilot -> TakeoffSuccess -> Autopilot: Transition from the Autopilot state back to itself when the vehicle successfully takes off.

Here is the C code representation of the state machine:

```c
typedef enum {
    STATE_GroundStation,
    STATE_Autopilot
} State;

typedef enum {
    EVENT_ConnectionSuccess,
    EVENT_ConnectionTimeout,
    EVENT_NewSystemDiscovered,
    EVENT_TakeoffSuccess
} Event;

State current_state = STATE_GroundStation;

void on_event(Event event)
{
    switch (current_state) {
        case STATE_GroundStation:
            switch (event) {
                case EVENT_ConnectionSuccess:
                    current_state = STATE_Autopilot;
                    break;
                case EVENT_ConnectionTimeout:
                    // No transition, stay in the same state
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
            break;
        case STATE_Autopilot:
            switch (event) {
                case EVENT_NewSystemDiscovered:
                    // No transition, stay in the same state
                    break;
                case EVENT_TakeoffSuccess:
                    // No transition, stay in the same state
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
}

int main()
{
    // ...

    // Transition from GroundStation to Autopilot upon ConnectionSuccess
    if (result == mavsdk::ConnectionResult::Success) {
        on_event(EVENT_ConnectionSuccess);
        std::cout << "Connected autopilot server side!" << std::endl;
    } else {
        // Transition from GroundStation to GroundStation upon ConnectionTimeout
        on_event(EVENT_ConnectionTimeout);
    }

    // ...

    // Transition from Autopilot to Autopilot upon NewSystemDiscovered
    mavsdkTester.subscribe_on_new_system([&mavsdkTester, &prom]() {
        std::cout << "Discovered MAVSDK GCS" << std::endl;
        auto system = mavsdkTester.systems().back();
        mavsdkTester.subscribe_on_new_system(nullptr);
        prom.set_value(system);
        
        on_event(EVENT_NewSystemDiscovered);
    });

    // ...

    // Transition from Autopilot to Autopilot upon TakeoffSuccess
    actionServer.subscribe_takeoff([&position](ActionServer::Result result, bool takeoff) {
        if (result == ActionServer::Result::Success) {
            position.relative_altitude_m = 10;
            on_event(EVENT_TakeoffSuccess);
        }
    });

    // ...
}
