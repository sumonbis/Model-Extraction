State Machine Description:
The state machine has the following states:
1. Initializing: The state machine is initializing the MAVSDK library and trying to establish a connection with the vehicle.
2. Discovering: The state machine is waiting to discover a new system and checking if it has a camera.
3. Camera Found: The state machine has found a system with a camera and is ready to switch to photo mode.
4. Switching Mode: The state machine is switching the camera mode to photo mode.
5. Photo Mode: The state machine has switched to photo mode and is ready to take a photo.
6. Taking Photo: The state machine is taking a photo using the camera.
7. Photo Taken: The state machine has successfully taken a photo and is waiting for capture information.
8. Exiting: The state machine has completed its tasks and is ready to exit.

The events and transitions in the state machine are as follows:
1. Initialize Event: Transition from Initializing state to Discovering state.
2. System Discovered Event: Transition from Discovering state to Camera Found state.
3. Switch Mode Event: Transition from Camera Found state to Switching Mode state.
4. Mode Switched Event: Transition from Switching Mode state to Photo Mode state.
5. Take Photo Event: Transition from Photo Mode state to Taking Photo state.
6. Photo Taken Event: Transition from Taking Photo state to Photo Taken state.
7. Timeout Event: Transition from Discovering state to Exiting state.

This C code implements the state machine described above. The main function handles the state transitions by triggering events and calling the `handle_event` function. The events are triggered at specific points in the source code. The state transitions are handled by the `handle_event` function, which updates the `state` variable accordingly.
