The signal-slot connections between the objects can be represented as a directed graph in DOT language. The nodes are objects, and the edges represent the connections between them. The internalValue state of each object is included as a label for the nodes, and the connection method used ("connect" or "disconnect") is included as a label for the edges.

The graph can be represented as follows:

```dot
digraph signal_slot_connections {
    node [shape=box];
    
    a [label="0, a"];
    b [label="0, b"];
    c [label="0, c"];
    d [label="0, d"];
    e [label="0, e"];
    
    a -> b [label="connect"];
    b -> c [label="connect"];
    c -> d [label="connect"];
    d -> e [label="connect"];
    e -> c [label="connect"];
}
```

This represents the cyclic signal-slot connections between the objects a, b, c, d, and e, as stated in the code comment.
