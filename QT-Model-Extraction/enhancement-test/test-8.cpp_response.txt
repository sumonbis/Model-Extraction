The signal-slot connections between the objects can be visualized using the DOT language as follows:

```
digraph signal_slots {
	node [shape=box];
	
	Repeater_0 [label="0\nNo man"];
	Repeater_1 [label="1\n"];
	Repeater_2 [label="2\n"];
	Repeater_3 [label="3\n"];
	Repeater_4 [label="4\n"];
	Repeater_4999 [label="4999\n"];
	
	Repeater_0 -> Repeater_1 [label="connect"];
	Repeater_1 -> Repeater_2 [label="connect"];
	Repeater_2 -> Repeater_3 [label="connect"];
	Repeater_3 -> Repeater_4 [label="connect"];
	Repeater_4 -> Repeater_4999 [label="connect"];
	Repeater_4999 -> Repeater_0 [label="connect"];
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph represents objects of the `Repeater` class.
- Each object is labeled with its `internalValue` state.
- The edges represent the signal-slot connections between the objects.
- The edge labels indicate the connection method used ("connect" in this case).

Note: The graph does not include the disconnection of signals and slots, as there are no disconnection statements in the given code.
