The signal-slot connections between the objects in the code are as follows:

- 'a' object:
  - signalRetransmit() connected to simpleRetransmit() of 'b' object.

The graph in DOT language representing the connections is as follows:

```
digraph Connections {
    "a (0, 'a')" [label="0, 'a'"]
    "b (0, 'b')" [label="0, 'b'"]
    "a (0, 'a')" -> "b (0, 'b')" [label="connect"]
}
```

Please note that this code snippet only shows a single connection between the objects 'a' and 'b'. If there are any other connections not shown in this code snippet, they should be added to the graph accordingly.
