The signal-slot connections between the objects can be represented as a graph in DOT language as follows:

```dot
digraph signal_slot_connections {
    Repeater0 [label="No man,0"]
    Repeater1 [label=",0"]
    Repeater2 [label=",0"]

    Repeater0 -> Repeater1 [label="connect"]
    Repeater1 -> Repeater2 [label="connect"]
    Repeater0 -> Repeater2 [label="connect"]
    Repeater1 -> Repeater2 [label="connect"]
    Repeater1 -> Repeater2 [label="connect"]
    Repeater2 -> Repeater1 [label="disconnect"]
}
```

Note: The graph only includes the signal-slot connections between the objects defined in the given code.
