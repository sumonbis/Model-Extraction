The signal-slot connections between the objects in the given code are as follows:

- Repeater (signalRetransmit) -> Repeater (simpleRetransmit) [Method: connect]
- Repeater (signalIncrement) -> Repeater (simpleIncrement) [Method: connect]

Based on the provided code, the DOT graph representation of the signal-slot connections is as follows:

```
digraph SignalSlotConnections {
  "Repeater(0, 'a')\nValue: 0" -> "Repeater(0, 'a')\nValue: 0" [label="connect"]
  "Repeater(0, 'a')\nValue: 0" -> "Repeater(0, 'a')\nValue: 0" [label="connect"]
}
```

Note: The DOT graph representation only includes the connections between the Repeater objects and not the catch block or other function calls in the code.
