The signal-slot connections between the objects can be represented in DOT language as follows:
```
digraph connections {
    "a (0)" -> "b (0)" [label="connect"];
    "a (0)" -> "c (0)" [label="connect"];
    "a (0)" -> "e (0)" [label="connect"];
    "a (0)" -> "g (0)" [label="connect"];
    "b (0)" -> "c (0)" [label="connect"];
    "c (0)" -> "d (0)" [label="connect"];
    "d (0)" -> "e (0)" [label="connect"];
    "e (0)" -> "f (0)" [label="connect"];
    "f (0)" -> "g (0)" [label="connect"];
    "g (0)" -> "h (0)" [label="connect"];
    "a (0)" -> "b (0)" [label="disconnect"];
    "a (0)" -> "c (0)" [label="disconnect"];
    "a (0)" -> "e (0)" [label="disconnect"];
    "a (0)" -> "g (0)" [label="disconnect"];
    "h (0)" -> "a (0)" [label="connect"];
}
```
In the above graph, each node represents an object with its internalValue state as part of the label. The edges represent the signal-slot connections between the objects, with the connection method ("connect" or "disconnect") included as part of the label.
