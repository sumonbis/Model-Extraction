The signal-slot connections between the objects can be represented using the following graph in DOT language:

```
digraph Connections {
    "Repeater(0,\"a\")\nValue: 0" -> "Repeater(0,\"a\")\nValue: 0" [label="connect"];
    "Repeater(0,\"a\")\nValue: 0" -> "Repeater(0,\"a\")\nValue: 0" [label="connect"];
    "Repeater(0,\"a\")\nValue: 0" -> "Repeater(0,\"a\")\nValue: 0" [label="connect"];
    "Repeater(0,\"a\")\nValue: 0" -> "Repeater(0,\"a\")\nValue: 0" [label="connect"];
}
```

Explanation:
- The object "Repeater(0,\"a\")\nValue: 0" is connected to itself using the signal and slot "signalRetransmit" and "secondaryRetransmit" respectively.
- The object "Repeater(0,\"a\")\nValue: 0" is also connected to itself using the signal and slot "signalSecondaryRetransmit" and "tertiaryRetransmit" respectively.
- Each connection is represented by the "connect" label.

Note: The other signal-slot connections mentioned in the code are not present in the provided function `regression_test_9()`, so they are not included in the graph.
