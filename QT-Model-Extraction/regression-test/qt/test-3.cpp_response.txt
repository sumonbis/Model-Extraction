The signal-slot connections between the objects can be summarized as follows:

1. Repeater object b:
- Connected signal: signalRetransmit() -> connected slot: simpleRetransmit()
- Connected signal: signalIncrement() -> connected slot: simpleIncrement()

Using the DOT language, the graph representation of the connections can be written as:

```dot
digraph SignalSlotConnections {
    node [shape = record];

    b [label = "b | Value: 0"];
    
    b -> b [label = "connect(signalRetransmit(), simpleRetransmit())"];
    b -> b [label = "connect(signalIncrement(), simpleIncrement())"];
}
```

Please note that there seems to be no explicit signal-slot connections defined in the code for the other signals and slots. Therefore, this is the only connection that can be identified based on the provided code.
