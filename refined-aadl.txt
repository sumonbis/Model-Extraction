To add actions like arm, takeoff, and land, we need to modify the `Action_Module` subprogram. We can add a new input port called `Command_Port` to receive the commands from ground control. We can also create a new output port called `Status_Port` that provides the status of the executed command back to ground control. 

Here's the updated `Action_Module` subprogram with added ports and components:

```
subprogram Action_Module

  features

    Shared_Ptr_Port: in data access shared_ptr;

    Action_Port: out data access action;

    Telemetry_Port: in data access telemetry;

    Send_Mavlink_Port: in data access send_mavlink;

    Command_Port: in event data port command;

    Status_Port: out event data port status;

  subcomponents

    Action: data MAVSDK.Action;

    Telemetry: data MAVSDK.Telemetry;

  connections

    shared_ptr_conn: feature group {
      required Shared_Ptr_Port: data access Shared_Ptr_Port;
      provided Shared_Ptr_Port: data access Action.Shared_Ptr_Port,
                                  data access Telemetry.Shared_Ptr_Port;
    }

    action_conn: feature group {
      provided Action_Port: data access Action.Perform_Action_Port;
      required Action_Port: data access Action_Port;
    }

    telemetry_conn: feature group {
      provided Telemetry_Port: data access Telemetry.Get_Telemetry_Port;
      required Telemetry_Port: data access Telemetry_Port;
    }

    mavlink_conn: feature group {
      required Send_Mavlink_Port: data access Send_Mavlink_Port;
      provided Send_Mavlink_Port: data access Action.Send_Mavlink_Port,
                                    data access Telemetry.Send_Mavlink_Port;
    }

    command_conn: feature group {
      required Command_Port: event data port command;
      provided Command_Port: event data port command;
      required Action_Port: data access Action_Port;
      provided Status_Port: event data port status;
    }

    status_conn: feature group {
      required Status_Port: event data port status;
      provided Status_Port: event data port status;
    }

end Action_Module
```

Now, whenever a command is sent from the ground control, it will trigger an event on the `Command_Port` of the `Action_Module`. This event will execute the necessary command through the `Action` subcomponent and provide the status of the executed command back to the ground control via the `Status_Port`.

We can define the commands that the `Action_Module` accepts and perform the corresponding action in the `Action` subcomponent. For example:

```
command accept(e: arm);
Action.arm();
Status_Port.event(armed);

command accept(e: takeoff);
Action.takeoff();
Status_Port.event(took_off);

command accept(e: land);
Action.land();
Status_Port.event(landed);
```

These commands `arm`, `takeoff`, and `land` will be executed by the `Action` subcomponent through the connection between `Command_Port` and `Action_Port`. Once the action is performed, the corresponding status event will be set on the `Status_Port` and sent back to the ground control.
