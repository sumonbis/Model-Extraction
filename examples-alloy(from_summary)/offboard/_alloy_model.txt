An Alloy model for the drone application source code can be represented as follows:

This Alloy model captures the relationships between the various components of the drone application source code, such as the functions, classes, and their respective parameters and return types. It also captures the associations between different components, such as the `Mavsdk` object and the `System` object, and the `Offboard` object and the `Telemetry` object. The model can be used to reason about the behavior and properties of the drone application at a high level.
