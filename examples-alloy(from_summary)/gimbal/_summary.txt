Explanation of the code syntax:
- The code begins with the inclusion of necessary C++ libraries such as `<chrono>`, `<cstdint>`, `<mavsdk/mavsdk.h>`, `<mavsdk/plugins/gimbal/gimbal.h>`, `<mavsdk/plugins/telemetry/telemetry.h>`, `<iostream>`, `<future>`, `<memory>`, and `<thread>`. These libraries provide functionalities for controlling drones and accessing telemetry data.
- The `using` statement is used to import the `std::chrono::seconds` and `std::this_thread::sleep_for` functions, which are used later in the code to introduce delays.
- The `usage()` function is defined to print the usage instructions for the application.
- The `get_system()` function is defined to discover and return the system with an autopilot that will be used for controlling the drone.
- The `main()` function is the entry point of the application. It takes the connection URL as a command line argument.
- The Mavsdk object `mavsdk` is created to interact with the MAVLink system.
- The `add_any_connection()` function is called on the `mavsdk` object to establish a connection with the drone using the provided URL.
- The `get_system()` function is called to obtain the system with an autopilot. If no autopilot is found within 3 seconds, the program terminates.
- The `Telemetry` and `Gimbal` objects are instantiated with the obtained system for accessing telemetry and gimbal functionalities, respectively.
- The camera/gimbal attitude rate is set to 5 Hz using the `set_rate_camera_attitude()` function of the `telemetry` object.
- A callback function is set using the `subscribe_camera_attitude_euler()` function of the `telemetry` object to monitor the camera/gimbal angles.
- Gimbal control is taken using the `take_control()` function of the `gimbal` object with the `Gimbal::ControlMode::Primary` control mode.
- Various gimbal angles and modes are set using the `set_mode()`, `set_pitch_and_yaw()`, `set_pitch_rate_and_yaw_rate()`, and `set_roi_location()` functions of the `gimbal` object.
- Finally, gimbal control is released using the `release_control()` function of the `gimbal` object.
- Error messages are printed if any of the gimbal functions fail.
- The program finishes by printing a success message and returning 0.
