AADL (Architecture Analysis and Design Language) is a modeling language primarily used for real-time and embedded systems. Although it supports modeling certain aspects of software architecture, it may not be the best choice for representing UML class-level relationships and interactions.

However, I can provide you with an example of how to represent the components and their connections using the AADL component-based modeling approach. Here's a simplified AADL model based on the given architecture description:

```aadl
-- Component definition
package Drone_Application
public
with Data_Models;

system Drone_System
public
with Data_Models;

subprogram Mavsdk
public
features
    connection_to_system: out Data_Models.System_Connection;
end Mavsdk;

subprogram Action
public
features
    connection_to_system: in out Data_Models.System_Connection;
end Action;

subprogram Offboard
public
features
    connection_to_system: in out Data_Models.System_Connection;
end Offboard;

subprogram Telemetry
public
features
    connection_to_system: in out Data_Models.System_Connection;
end Telemetry;

end Drone_Application;

-- Connection definition
package Data_Models
public

data System_Connection
end System_Connection;

end Data_Models;

-- System connection binding
system implementation Drone_System.impl
subcomponents
    mavsdk: Mavsdk;
    action: Action;
    offboard: Offboard;
    telemetry: Telemetry;
end Drone_System.impl;

connection binding System_Connection_to_Mavsdk
data access connection_to_system
end System_Connection_to_Mavsdk;

connection binding System_Connection_to_Action
data access connection_to_system
end System_Connection_to_Action;

connection binding System_Connection_to_Offboard
data access connection_to_system
end System_Connection_to_Offboard;

connection binding System_Connection_to_Telemetry
data access connection_to_system
end System_Connection_to_Telemetry;

bind Drone_System.impl.mavsdk.connection_to_system => Drone_System.impl_mavsdk_connection;
bind Drone_System.impl.action.connection_to_system => Drone_System.impl_action_connection;
bind Drone_System.impl.offboard.connection_to_system => Drone_System.impl_offboard_connection;
bind Drone_System.impl.telemetry.connection_to_system => Drone_System.impl_telemetry_connection;

end;

```

Please note that this is a simplified AADL model and you may need to further specify the interfaces, communication patterns, and properties based on your specific requirements and constraints. Additionally, you would need to provide more information about the data types and properties used in the model, which are not defined in the given architecture description.

Feel free to customize and expand the AADL model as per your requirements.
