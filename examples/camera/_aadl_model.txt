This AADL model represents the different system components and their interactions as described in the UML architecture. It captures the relationships between the main class, MAVSDK library, Camera plugin, Telemetry plugin, System, CaptureInfo class, Future and Promise classes, sleep_for and Console I/O components. Connections and flows are also defined to denote communication between the components.
