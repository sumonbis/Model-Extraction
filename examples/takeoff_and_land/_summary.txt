The main components in the architecture are as follows:

1. Mavsdk: It represents the SDK for communication with the drone. It is responsible for adding connections and getting the system.
2. Telemetry: It represents the plugin for getting and setting drone telemetry data like position, altitude, etc.
3. Action: It represents the plugin for performing actions on the drone like arming, taking off, landing, etc.
4. System: It represents the connected drone system. It is retrieved from Mavsdk after connection.
5. Position: It represents the telemetry data structure for position information (e.g., relative_altitude_m).
6. Result: It represents the action result data structure for arming, takeoff, land, etc.

The connections between the components are as follows:

1. Mavsdk has a connection to System. It adds the connection and retrieves the system.
2. Telemetry and Action have a connection to System. They are instantiated with the system to perform telemetry and action operations.
3. Telemetry has a connection to Position. It subscribes to the position updates and receives the position data structure.
4. Action has a connection to Result. It returns the result of action operations like arming, takeoff, land, etc.
5. System has connections to Telemetry and Action. It provides telemetry and action functionalities to the components.

The syntax in the code:

1. `#include <mavsdk/mavsdk.h>`: It includes the Mavsdk library header file for communication with the drone.
2. `using namespace mavsdk;`: It imports the `mavsdk` namespace to provide access to the Mavsdk classes without explicit qualification.
3. `shared_ptr<System>`: It is a shared pointer to the System class, representing a connected drone system.
4. `auto prom = std::promise<std::shared_ptr<System>>{};` and `auto fut = prom.get_future();`: These lines create a promise and a future to get the shared pointer to the System object asynchronously.
5. `mavsdk.subscribe_on_new_system`: It subscribes to new system discovery events and performs actions when a system with an autopilot is found.
6. `Mavsdk mavsdk;`: It creates an instance of the Mavsdk class.
7. `ConnectionResult connection_result = mavsdk.add_any_connection(argv[1]);`: It adds a connection to the drone using the provided connection URL.
8. `auto system = get_system(mavsdk);`: It retrieves the system using the get_system function.
9. `auto telemetry = Telemetry{system};` and `auto action = Action{system};`: These lines instantiate the Telemetry and Action plugins with the system to perform telemetry and action operations.
10. `telemetry.subscribe_position`: It subscribes to position updates and performs actions when a new position is received.
11. `telemetry.health_all_ok()`: It checks if the vehicle is ready to arm by checking the health status.
12. `action.arm()`, `action.takeoff()`, `action.land()`: These lines perform the respective actions on the drone.
13. `telemetry.in_air()`: It checks if the vehicle is still in the air.
14. `sleep_for(seconds(1))`: It pauses the execution for the specified duration in seconds.

Please note that the given code is for demonstration purposes and may require additional error handling and exception management for real-world applications.
