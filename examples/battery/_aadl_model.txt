Here is the AADL model for the given architecture description:

```
package DroneApp is
    public with Data_Model;

    -- Components
    system Telemetry_Subscriber_Armed
        features
            subscribe_armed: in data port;
            armed_state: out event data port;

    system MavlinkPassthrough_API
        features
            send_message: in data port;

    system Drone_System
        features
            system_component: out data port;

    -- Connections
    connection Subscribe_Armed_Connection
        port subscribe_armed -> subscribe_armed;

    connection Send_Message_Connection
        port send_message -> send_message;

    connection Drone_Passthrough
        port armed_state -> system_component;

    -- Data Model
    data Boolean
        properties
            range zero_to_one;

end DroneApp;
```

Explanation:
- The architecture model is represented using the package "DroneApp".
- There are three system components: "Telemetry_Subscriber_Armed", "MavlinkPassthrough_API", and "Drone_System".
- The "Telemetry_Subscriber_Armed" component has an incoming data port "subscribe_armed" and an outgoing event data port "armed_state".
- The "MavlinkPassthrough_API" component has an incoming data port "send_message".
- The "Drone_System" component has an outgoing data port "system_component".
- The connections are defined using the "connection" keyword. The "Subscribe_Armed_Connection" connects the "subscribe_armed" port of "Telemetry_Subscriber_Armed" to the "subscribe_armed" port of the system component. The "Send_Message_Connection" connects the "send_message" port of "MavlinkPassthrough_API" to the "send_message" port of the system component. The "Drone_Passthrough" connects the "armed_state" port of "Telemetry_Subscriber_Armed" to the "system_component" port of the system component.
- A data model is defined for the "Boolean" type with the range constraint from 0 to 1. This data model is used to represent the armed state of the drone.
