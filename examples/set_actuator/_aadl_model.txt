Here is an AADL model for the given architecture description:

```
-- Component Types --
abstract implementation MAVSDK;
abstract implementation Action_Plugin;
abstract implementation System;
abstract implementation Mavsdk_Interface;
abstract implementation Action_Interface;

-- Components --
system Mavsdk_System is
   features
      Mavsdk : provides Mavsdk_Interface;
      Action_Plugin : provides Action_Interface;
      System : requires System;
   end Mavsdk_System;

subprogram Mavsdk_Plugin is
   features
      Action_Plugin : provides Action_Interface;
   end Mavsdk_Plugin;

-- Interfaces --
data port Mavsdk_Port is
   operations
      add_connection(in connection_url : string);
      subscribe_to_new_system(in callback : System_Callback);
      get_system_list(out system_list : string array);
   end Mavsdk_Port;

data port Action_Port is
   operations
      set_actuator(in index : integer, in value : real);
   end Action_Port;

-- Connections --
system Mavsdk_Plugin_System_Connection is
   connection Mavsdk_Port -> Mavsdk_Plugin.Action_Plugin;
end Mavsdk_Plugin_System_Connection;

system Main_System_Connection is
   connection Mavsdk_Port -> Main.Component1;
   connection System -> Main.Component1;
   connection Action_Port -> Main.Component1;
end Main_System_Connection;

```
Note: This is a simplified AADL model that captures the high-level components and interfaces described in the UML architecture description. It does not include the details of internal components and interfaces of the MAVSDK library.
