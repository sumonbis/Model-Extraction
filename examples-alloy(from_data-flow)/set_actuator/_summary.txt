The data-flow and control flow relations in the given drone application code can be described as follows:

Data-Flow:
1. The main function takes the connection URL, actuator index, and actuator value as input arguments.
2. The connection URL, actuator index, and actuator value are stored in variables.
3. The Mavsdk object is instantiated.
4. The connection URL is passed to the Mavsdk object to establish a connection to the drone.
5. The result of the connection is stored in the connection_result variable.
6. If the connection is successful, the system discovery process begins.
7. The main function waits for a new system to be discovered.
8. Once a system with an autopilot is discovered, the system is stored in the system variable and the system discovery process is stopped.
9. If no autopilot is found within 3 seconds, an error message is printed and the program exits.
10. The system object is obtained from the future object.
11. The Action plugin is instantiated with the system object.
12. The actuator index and value are passed to the Action plugin to set the actuator.
13. The result of setting the actuator is stored in the set_actuator_result variable.

Control Flow:
1. The main function checks if the number of input arguments is correct. If not, it prints the usage information and exits.
2. The main function establishes a connection to the drone using the provided connection URL.
3. If the connection is successful, the main function waits for a system with an autopilot to be discovered.
4. Once a system with an autopilot is discovered, the main function retrieves the system object and instantiates the Action plugin.
5. The main function sets the actuator using the Action plugin and checks the result.
6. The main function returns an exit code of 0 if everything is successful, or 1 if there was an error.
