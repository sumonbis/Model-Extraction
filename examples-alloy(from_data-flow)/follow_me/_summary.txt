The data-flow and control flow relations for the given drone application code can be described as follows:

Data-flow relations:
1. The main function receives the connection URL as a command line argument.
2. The Mavsdk instance is created.
3. The connection URL is added to the Mavsdk instance to establish a connection with the drone.
4. The get_system function is called to discover the system with an autopilot.
5. The system instance is obtained from the promise/future mechanism in the get_system function.
6. Plugin instances (Action, FollowMe, Telemetry) are created using the obtained system instance.
7. Telemetry position updates are subscribed, and the position data is printed to the console.
8. Telemetry flight mode updates are subscribed, and the flight mode data is printed to the console.
9. The FakeLocationProvider registers for location updates and sets the target location for FollowMe.
10. FollowMe start/stop commands are sent based on the FakeLocationProvider updates.

Control flow relations:
1. The main function checks the command line argument count and displays usage information if count is not 2.
2. Connection is established with the drone using the Mavsdk instance.
3. The get_system function waits for the discovery of a system with an autopilot within a timeout period.
4. If a system with an autopilot is discovered, the autopilot is used; otherwise, an error message is printed, and the program exits.
5. The main while loop waits for the system to be ready by checking telemetry health status.
6. The system is armed using the Action plugin.
7. Telemetry position updates are subscribed, and the position data is printed to the console.
8. Telemetry flight mode updates are subscribed, and the flight mode data is printed to the console.
9. The Action plugin is used to perform takeoff.
10. FollowMe configuration is set using the FollowMe plugin.
11. FollowMe is started using the FollowMe plugin.
12. The FakeLocationProvider registers for location updates and sets the target location for FollowMe.
13. The main while loop waits for the FakeLocationProvider to be running.
14. FollowMe is stopped using the FollowMe plugin.
15. Telemetry flight mode updates subscription is canceled.
16. The Action plugin is used to perform landing.
17. The main while loop waits for the drone to land.
18. The main while loop waits for the drone to be disarmed.
19. The program exits with a return value of 0.
