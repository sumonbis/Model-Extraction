The data-flow and control flow relations in the given drone application code can be described as follows:

Data-Flow Relations:
1. The connection URL (argv[1]) is passed to the `add_any_connection` function of the `Mavsdk` object to establish a connection with the drone.
2. The connected system instance is obtained from the `mavsdk.systems()` vector.
3. Telemetry and Action plugins are instantiated, using the connected system instance.
4. The telemetry rate is set to 1 Hz using the `set_rate_position` function of the Telemetry plugin.
5. The `subscribe_position` callback function is set to receive altitude updates from the drone.
6. The `health_all_ok` function is used to check the health status of the drone.
7. The `arm` function of the Action plugin is called to arm the drone.
8. The `takeoff` function of the Action plugin is called to initiate the drone takeoff.
9. The program waits for 10 seconds using `sleep_for` function before landing the drone.
10. The `land` function of the Action plugin is called to initiate the drone landing.
11. The program continuously checks if the drone is still in the air using the `in_air` function of the Telemetry plugin.
12. After the drone has landed, the program waits for 3 seconds using `sleep_for` function.
13. The program finishes execution.

Control Flow Relations:
1. The main function first checks the command line arguments and shows the usage if the argument count is not 2.
2. The Mavsdk object is created and the connection with the drone is established using the connection URL.
3. The `get_system` function is called to obtain the connected drone system.
4. If no system is found within 3 seconds, the program exits.
5. The Telemetry and Action plugins are instantiated using the obtained system instance.
6. The telemetry rate is set, and the altitude callback is registered.
7. The program enters a while loop and waits until the drone is ready to arm.
8. After the vehicle is ready, the drone is armed using the Action plugin.
9. Takeoff is initiated by calling the takeoff function of the Action plugin.
10. The program waits for 10 seconds for the drone to hover.
11. The drone is landed using the Action plugin's land function.
12. A while loop is used to wait until the drone has landed completely.
13. After landing, the program waits for 3 seconds before finishing execution.
