The data-flow and control flow relations in the given drone application code can be described as follows:

Data-Flow:
1. The main function takes the connection URL as an argument and stores it in the 'connection_url' variable.
2. The 'connection_url' variable is used to establish a connection with the drone using the Mavsdk library.
3. The 'system' variable is assigned the system object from the Mavsdk systems list.
4. The 'action' object is instantiated with the 'system' object.
5. User input is stored in the 'type' variable.
6. The 'terminate' function of the 'action' object is called to send the termination command to the drone.

Control Flow:
1. The 'usage' function is called to display the correct usage of the program if the number of command-line arguments is not equal to 2.
2. The 'mavsdk.subscribe_on_new_system' function is called to subscribe to new systems being discovered.
3. The connection is added using the 'mavsdk.add_any_connection' function.
4. The program waits for a new system to be discovered using the promise and future mechanism.
5. If a system with an autopilot is discovered within the timeout period, the program continues; otherwise, it exits.
6. The 'action.terminate' function is called if the user inputs 'y' or 'Y'; otherwise, the program exits.

Overall, the code connects to a drone system, waits for an autopilot to be discovered, prompts the user for termination confirmation, and sends the termination command to the drone if confirmed.
