The data-flow and control flow relations for the provided drone application code can be summarized as follows:

Data-flow relations:
1. The connection URL is provided as a command-line argument.
2. The connection URL is passed to the `add_any_connection` method of the `Mavsdk` class, which establishes a connection to the drone system.
3. The `subscribe_on_new_system` method is called to wait for new systems to be discovered.
4. When a system with a camera is discovered, the `system` object is assigned.
5. The `system` object is passed to the constructors of the `Telemetry` and `Camera` classes to instantiate the plugins.
6. The camera mode is set to Photo mode.
7. The `subscribe_capture_info` method is called to subscribe to information about pictures that are taken.
8. The `take_photo` method is called to capture a photo.

Control flow relations:
1. The main function starts by checking the command-line arguments. If there is not exactly one argument, the `usage` function is called and the program exits.
2. The connection to the drone system is established, and if the connection fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.
3. The program waits for new systems to be discovered and assigns the system with a camera to the `system` object.
4. If no camera is found within 3 seconds, an error message is printed and the program exits.
5. The plugins are instantiated.
6. The camera mode is set to Photo mode, and if the mode switch fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.
7. The program subscribes to capture information and takes a photo using the camera.
8. The program sleeps for 2 seconds to allow time for the capture information to be displayed.
9. The program exits with a return value of 0, indicating successful execution.
