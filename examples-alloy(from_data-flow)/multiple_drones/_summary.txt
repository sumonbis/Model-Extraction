The data-flow and control flow relations for the given drone application code are as follows:

Data flow:
1. The main function receives the connection URLs as command line arguments.
2. The connection URLs are passed to the Mavsdk object.
3. The Mavsdk object establishes connections to the vehicles using the provided connection URLs.
4. The main function waits for system discovery to complete.
5. Once the systems are discovered, the main function creates threads to handle each system.
6. Each thread calls the takeoff_and_land function with a System object.
7. Inside the takeoff_and_land function, telemetry and action objects are created for the system.
8. The telemetry object sets the position update rate.
9. The telemetry object subscribes to position updates and prints the altitude.
10. The takeoff_and_land function checks if the vehicle is ready to arm using telemetry.health_all_ok().
11. If the vehicle is not ready, it waits for 1 second and checks again.
12. If the vehicle is ready, the action object arms the vehicle.
13. The action object then takes off the vehicle.
14. After a 20 second delay, the action object lands the vehicle.
15. The takeoff_and_land function checks if the vehicle is still in the air using telemetry.in_air().
16. If the vehicle is still in the air, it waits for 1 second and checks again.
17. Once the vehicle has landed, the function waits for 5 seconds and then prints "Finished".

Control flow:
1. The main function checks if the connection URLs are provided as command line arguments.
2. If not, it prints an error message and exits.
3. The main function creates an instance of the Mavsdk object.
4. The main function adds the connection URLs to the Mavsdk object.
5. The main function subscribes to new system events and waits for system discovery.
6. Once the systems are discovered, the main function creates threads and calls the takeoff_and_land function for each system.
7. The threads execute in parallel.
8. After all threads have finished, the main function exits.
9. The takeoff_and_land function sets the position update rate, subscribes to position updates, and checks if the vehicle is ready to arm in a loop.
10. If the vehicle is ready to arm, the function arms the vehicle, takes off, lands, and checks if the vehicle is still in the air in a loop.
11. Once the vehicle has landed, the function waits for a few seconds and then finishes.
