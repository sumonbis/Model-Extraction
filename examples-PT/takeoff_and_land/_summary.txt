The given source code is an example that demonstrates how to use MAVSDK to control a drone. It connects to the drone, arms it, takes off, hovers for a specific duration, lands, and then checks if the drone has landed successfully.

To create a state machine description in C for this source code, we can identify the different states and transitions in the code and map them accordingly. Here is a possible state machine description for the given code:

```c
enum State {
    WAIT_FOR_CONNECTION,
    DISCOVER_SYSTEM,
    ARMING,
    TAKEOFF,
    HOVER,
    LANDING,
    CHECK_LANDED,
    FINISHED
};

enum Event {
    CONNECTION_SUCCESS,
    CONNECTION_FAILURE,
    SYSTEM_DISCOVERED,
    ARM_SUCCESS,
    ARM_FAILURE,
    TAKEOFF_SUCCESS,
    TAKEOFF_FAILURE,
    HOVER_TIMEOUT,
    LAND_SUCCESS,
    LAND_FAILURE,
    CHECK_LANDED_SUCCESS,
    CHECK_LANDED_FAILURE
};

void handle_event(State& current_state, Event event)
{
    switch (current_state) {
        case WAIT_FOR_CONNECTION:
            if (event == CONNECTION_SUCCESS) {
                current_state = DISCOVER_SYSTEM;
            } else if (event == CONNECTION_FAILURE) {
                // Handle failure
            }
            break;
        
        case DISCOVER_SYSTEM:
            if (event == SYSTEM_DISCOVERED) {
                current_state = ARMING;
            }
            break;
        
        case ARMING:
            if (event == ARM_SUCCESS) {
                current_state = TAKEOFF;
            } else if (event == ARM_FAILURE) {
                // Handle failure
            }
            break;
        
        case TAKEOFF:
            if (event == TAKEOFF_SUCCESS) {
                current_state = HOVER;
            } else if (event == TAKEOFF_FAILURE) {
                // Handle failure
            }
            break;

        case HOVER:
            if (event == HOVER_TIMEOUT) {
                current_state = LANDING;
            }
            break;
        
        case LANDING:
            if (event == LAND_SUCCESS) {
                current_state = CHECK_LANDED;
            } else if (event == LAND_FAILURE) {
                // Handle failure
            }
            break;

        case CHECK_LANDED:
            if (event == CHECK_LANDED_SUCCESS) {
                current_state = FINISHED;
            } else if (event == CHECK_LANDED_FAILURE) {
                // Handle failure
            }
            break;
    }
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    // State machine initialization
    State current_state = WAIT_FOR_CONNECTION;
    
    // Start MAVSDK and connection
    // ...
    
    while (current_state != FINISHED) {
        // Event handling based on current state
        switch (current_state) {
            case WAIT_FOR_CONNECTION:
                // Wait for connection success or failure event
                // ...
                break;
            
            case DISCOVER_SYSTEM:
                // Wait for system discovery event
                // ...
                break;
            
            case ARMING:
                // Wait for arm success or failure event
                // ...
                break;
            
            case TAKEOFF:
                // Wait for takeoff success or failure event
                // ...
                break;

            case HOVER:
                // Wait for hover timeout event
                // ...
                break;
            
            case LANDING:
                // Wait for land success or failure event
                // ...
                break;

            case CHECK_LANDED:
                // Wait for check landed success or failure event
                // ...
                break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The C code based on the state machine description maps the states and events from the source code to the respective states and events in the state machine. This is done by introducing enums for the states and events and by writing the event handling logic within a while loop. The state transitions are handled by the `handle_event` function which updates the current state based on the current state and the received event. The event handling logic in the while loop waits for specific events based on the current state and performs the required actions (e.g., connecting, discovering system, arming, takeoff, hovering, landing) and triggers the appropriate events based on the success or failure of each action.

Note that the actual implementation of waiting for events and handling them is not provided in the code snippet above as it depends on the specific implementation of MAVSDK and its API.
