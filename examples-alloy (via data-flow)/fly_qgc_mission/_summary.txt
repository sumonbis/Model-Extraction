Data-flow relations:
1. The application reads the connection URL and mission plan path from the command line arguments (argv).
2. The application creates a Mavsdk object and adds a connection using the provided connection URL.
3. The application calls the get_system function to discover and get the system with an autopilot.
4. The application creates Action, MissionRaw, and Telemetry objects using the system.
5. The application waits for the system to be ready by checking telemetry health status in a loop.
6. The application imports mission items from the provided mission plan using the mission_raw object.
7. The application uploads the mission items to the vehicle using the mission_raw object.
8. The application arms the vehicle using the action object.
9. The application starts the mission using the mission_raw object.
10. The application waits for the mission to finish by subscribing to mission progress updates.
11. The application commands Return to Launch (RTL) once the mission is accomplished using the action object.

Control flow relations:
1. The application checks the number of command line arguments and displays usage information if incorrect.
2. If the connection to the vehicle fails, the application displays the connection result and exits.
3. If the system with an autopilot is not found, the application exits.
4. If importing the mission items fails, the application displays an error message and exits.
5. If there are no mission items in the plan, the application displays an error message and exits.
6. If uploading the mission items fails, the application displays an error message and exits.
7. If arming the vehicle fails, the application displays an error message and exits.
8. If starting the mission fails, the application displays an error message and exits.
9. If the mission does not finish within 240 seconds, the application displays an error message and exits.
10. If commanding RTL fails, the application displays an error message and exits.
11. If everything succeeds, the application returns 0 to indicate success.
