The data-flow and control flow relations in the given drone application code can be described as follows:

Data-flow:
1. The main function receives the connection URL as a command line argument and initializes the Mavsdk object.
2. The main function adds the connection using the add_any_connection method of the Mavsdk object.
3. The main function calls the get_system function to discover and get the autopilot system.
4. The get_system function subscribes to new system events and waits for a system with an autopilot to be discovered.
5. The get_system function returns the shared pointer to the discovered system.
6. The main function checks if a system is successfully discovered and returns if not.
7. The main function creates instances of Telemetry and MavlinkPassthrough plugins.
8. The main function calls the subscribe_armed function to subscribe to the armed state change events.
9. The main function enters an infinite loop where it periodically calls the send_battery_status function and sleeps for 1 second.

Control flow:
1. The main function checks the number of command line arguments and displays the usage if incorrect.
2. The main function initializes the Mavsdk object and adds the connection using the add_any_connection method.
3. The main function calls the get_system function to get the discovered autopilot system.
4. The main function checks if a system is successfully discovered and returns if not.
5. The main function creates instances of Telemetry and MavlinkPassthrough plugins.
6. The main function calls the subscribe_armed function to subscribe to the armed state change events.
7. The main function enters an infinite loop where it periodically calls the send_battery_status function and sleeps for 1 second.
8. The subscribe_armed function subscribes to the armed state change events and prints the state when it changes.
9. The send_battery_status function creates a mavlink message representing the battery status and sends it using the MavlinkPassthrough plugin.
