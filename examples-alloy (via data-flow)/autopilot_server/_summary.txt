The data-flow and control flow relations for the given drone application code can be described as follows:

Data-flow:
1. The main thread creates an instance of the MAVSDK object and adds a connection.
2. The main thread subscribes to the new system event and waits for the autopilot system to be discovered.
3. The main thread creates instances of the Action, Param, and Telemetry plugins.
4. The main thread sets up a callback to monitor the altitude of the drone using the Telemetry plugin.
5. The main thread arms the vehicle and sets the takeoff altitude using the Action plugin.
6. The main thread initiates takeoff using the Action plugin.

Control flow:
1. The main thread starts a separate autopilot thread.
2. The autopilot thread creates another instance of the MAVSDK object and adds a connection to the autopilot.
3. The autopilot thread subscribes to the new system event and waits for the GCS system to be discovered.
4. The autopilot thread sets up the server plugins (ParamServer, TelemetryServer, ActionServer, MissionRawServer) using the autopilot system.
5. The autopilot thread provides parameters, sets allowable flight modes, and arms the vehicle using the server plugins.
6. The autopilot thread creates a mission raw server and subscribes to incoming mission, current item changed, and clear all events.
7. The autopilot thread sets the current mission item to complete.
8. The autopilot thread publishes telemetry information continuously using the TelemetryServer plugin.
9. The main thread checks for the custom param set in the server thread using the Param plugin.
10. The main thread creates a mission and uploads it to the mission server using the Mission plugin.
11. The main thread clears the mission and subscribes to mission progress events.
12. The main thread waits for 20 seconds.
13. The main thread sets the rate for position updates using the Telemetry plugin.
14. The main thread monitors the altitude using a callback.
15. The main thread waits for the vehicle to be ready to arm using the Telemetry plugin.
16. The main thread arms the vehicle and sets the takeoff altitude using the Action plugin.
17. The main thread initiates takeoff using the Action plugin.
