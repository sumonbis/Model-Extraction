Here is an Alloy model that represents the given data and control-flow description:

```alloy
sig System {}
sig Telemetry {}
sig Action {}

fact {
  // Data-Flow
  all s: System | one m: Main |
    m.connURL = s.connURL

  all m: Main |
    one t: Telemetry |
      t.system = m.system

  all m: Main |
    one a: Action |
      a.system = m.system
      
  // Control-Flow
  Main.next = connURL =>
    one t: Telemetry |
      one a: Action |
        let s = m.system |
          some m.connURL implies t.rate = 1 and m.callback = t.altitudeMonitor and (
            t.waitReadyToArm and a.arm and a.takeoff and a.transitionToFixedWing and a.transitionToMulticopter and a.land and waitLandedDisarmed
          ) and (not t.waitReadyToArm and not a.arm and not a.takeoff and not a.transitionToFixedWing and not a.transitionToMulticopter and not a.land and not waitLandedDisarmed)

  all m: Main | m.callback in Telemetry -> Boolean
}

pred waitLandedDisarmed[m: Main] {
  m.waitLandedDisarmed = true
}

pred show {
  some m: Main |
    some t: Telemetry |
      some a: Action |
        some s: System |
          show m, t, a, s
}

run show for 5
```

Please note that Alloy is a formal modeling language, and this model is a simplified representation of the system. The purpose of Alloy is to check for consistency, find constraints, and generate instances that satisfy the given constraints.
