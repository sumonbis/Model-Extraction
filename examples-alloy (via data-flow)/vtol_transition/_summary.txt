Data-Flow:
1. The main function receives the connection URL as an argument.
2. The connection URL is used to establish a connection to the drone through the Mavsdk library.
3. The get_system function is called to retrieve the system information of the connected drone.
4. The Telemetry and Action plugins are instantiated with the system object.
5. The telemetry plugin is set to receive position updates from the drone at a rate of 1Hz.
6. A callback function is set up to monitor the altitude of the drone.
7. The program waits until the drone is ready for arming.
8. The action plugin is used to arm the drone.
9. The action plugin is used to initiate takeoff.
10. The program waits for 10 seconds while the drone takes off.
11. The action plugin is used to transition the drone to fixed-wing mode.
12. The program waits for 30 seconds while the drone loiters in fixed-wing mode.
13. The action plugin is used to send the drone to a specific location.
14. The program waits for 20 seconds while the drone reaches the specified location.
15. The action plugin is used to transition the drone back to multicopter mode.
16. The program waits for 5 seconds for the transition to be carried out.
17. The action plugin is used to initiate landing.
18. The program waits until the drone has landed and disarmed.

Control-Flow:
1. The main function checks the number of command line arguments and displays usage instructions if incorrect.
2. The main function uses the Mavsdk library to establish a connection to the drone using the provided connection URL.
3. The get_system function is called to retrieve the system object representing the connected drone.
4. The Telemetry and Action plugins are instantiated with the system object.
5. The telemetry plugin is set to receive position updates from the drone at a rate of 1Hz.
6. A callback function is set up to monitor the altitude of the drone.
7. The program enters a loop and waits until the telemetry reports that the drone is ready for arming.
8. The action plugin is used to arm the drone.
9. The action plugin is used to initiate takeoff.
10. The program waits for 10 seconds while the drone takes off.
11. The action plugin is used to transition the drone to fixed-wing mode.
12. The program waits for 30 seconds while the drone loiters in fixed-wing mode.
13. The action plugin is used to send the drone to a specific location.
14. The program waits for 20 seconds while the drone reaches the specified location.
15. The action plugin is used to transition the drone back to multicopter mode.
16. The program waits for 5 seconds for the transition to be carried out.
17. The action plugin is used to initiate landing.
18. The program enters a loop and waits until the telemetry reports that the drone has landed and disarmed.
19. The program exits with a success status code.
