The Alloy model for the given data and control-flow description can be represented as follows:

```alloy
sig Mavsdk, Camera, Command, CurrentSettings, UserInput, String, CameraMode, CameraSetting {}

sig Drone {
  mavsdk: Mavsdk,
  camera: Camera,
  currentSettings: CurrentSettings,
  userInput: UserInput
}

fact DataFlow {
  Drone.currentSettings = CurrentSettings
  Drone.currentSettings in Camera.displaySettings
  Drone.currentSettings in Camera.availableSettings
  UserInput.selectedSettings in Camera.changeSettings
}

fact ControlFlow {
  all d: Drone |
    d.mavsdk in Mavsdk and
    d.camera in Camera and
    d.currentSettings in CurrentSettings and
    d.userInput in UserInput
  d.mavsdk -> d.camera in Command.createCamera
  drones.mavsdk in Command.connect
  drones.mavsdk -> drones.camera in Command.discoverCamera
  drones.camera -> drones.currentSettings in Camera.subscribeSettings
  drones.camera -> drones.userInput in UserInput.receive
  CommandLine -> Mavsdk in Command.parseURL
  drones.camera -> CameraMode in UserInput.selectMode
  drones.camera -> CameraSetting in UserInput.selectSetting
  drones.camera -> Command.exit in UserInput.selectQuit
}

run {
  some Drone // At least one drone exists in the model
} for 5
```

This Alloy model defines the fundamental data types and their relationships. The `Drone` signature represents a drone object that consists of the MAVSDK, Camera, CurrentSettings, and UserInput components. The `DataFlow` fact establishes the data-flow relations between the components. The `ControlFlow` fact represents the control-flow relations between the components. The `run` declaration ensures that there is at least one drone in the model.
