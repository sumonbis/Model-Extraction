Here is an Alloy model that represents the data-flow and control-flow relations in the provided code:

```alloy
open util/boolean
open util/relation

abstract sig Function {}
one sig Main, Usage, GetSystem, RunInteractiveShell extends Function {}

abstract sig Variable {}
one sig ConnectionURL, ConnectionResult extends Variable {}

abstract sig Object {}
one sig Mavsdk extends Object {}

abstract sig Pointer {}
one sig SystemPointer extends Pointer {}

// Data-flow relation
sig DataFlow {
    from: Function,
    to: Function,
    data: Variable
}

// Control-flow relation
sig ControlFlow {
    from: Function,
    to: Function
}

// Relation between functions, control-flow and data-flow
sig FunctionRelation {
    func: Function,
    control: ControlFlow,
    data: DataFlow
}

// Execution of functions
one sig Execution {
    executed: some Function
}

// Constraints
fact {
    // Control-flow constraints
    Main not in Main.^~to  // No direct or indirect recursive calls to Main
    Usage not in Usage.^~to  // No direct or indirect recursive calls to Usage
    GetSystem not in GetSystem.^~to  // No direct or indirect recursive calls to GetSystem
    RunInteractiveShell not in RunInteractiveShell.^~to  // No direct or indirect recursive calls to RunInteractiveShell

    // The main function is called at the beginning
    no Main.^to

    // The usage function is called at the beginning of the main function
    Main in Usage.^to

    // The correct number of command-line arguments is checked in the main function
    Main in ConnectionURL.^from

    // If the correct number of command-line arguments is not provided, the usage function is called
    ConnectionURL in Usage.^from

    // The Mavsdk object is created in the main function
    Main in Mavsdk.^from

    // The connection URL is passed to the add_any_connection method of the Mavsdk object
    ConnectionURL in add_any_connection.data

    // The result of the connection is stored in the connection_result variable
    ConnectionResult in add_any_connection.data

    // If the connection is not successful, an error message is printed and the program returns with an error code
    add_any_connection not in ConnectionResult.^from

    // If the connection is successful, the get_system function is called
    ConnectionResult in GetSystem.^from

    // The get_system function waits for the discovery of a new system with an autopilot
    // and returns an empty shared pointer if no autopilot is found
    GetSystem in SystemPointer.^to

    // Once an autopilot system is discovered, the main function continues
    SystemPointer in GetSystem.^to

    // The run_interactive_shell function is called with the retrieved system object
    GetSystem in RunInteractiveShell.^to

    // Inside the run_interactive_shell function, a Shell object is instantiated with the system object
    RunInteractiveShell in Shell.^from

    // The subscribe_receive method of the Shell object is called to subscribe to receive outputs from the shell
    Shell in subscribe_receive.data

    // The user commands are sent to the shell using the send method of the Shell object
    send in Shell.data

    // If the command is "exit", the run_interactive_shell function ends
    send - "exit" not in RunInteractiveShell.^to

    // If the command is not "exit", it is sent to the shell
    "exit" not in send.~data

    // The user can continuously enter commands until "exit" is entered
    RunInteractiveShell.*to & send.*data - "exit" = RunInteractiveShell.*to & send.*data

    // After exiting the while loop, a newline character is printed
    "\n" in RunInteractiveShell.^to

    // The run_interactive_shell function returns
    no RunInteractiveShell.^to

    // The main function returns with a success code
    no Main.^to
}
```

This Alloy model represents the data-flow and control-flow relations described in the code. It defines several sigs to represent functions, variables, objects, pointers, and relations. The constraints ensure that the control-flow and data-flow relations are satisfied within the code. The Execution sig represents the execution of functions, and the model checks if the constraints hold for any possible execution.
