```

This AADL model represents the MAVSDK library, along with its Action, MissionRaw, and Telemetry plugin modules, as separate features of the DroneApp system. The `CONNECTION` sections define the data access connections between the modules.

The `SUBPROGRAM MAIN` represents the main function of the drone application code. It contains subprograms for connecting to the drone, importing and uploading the mission plan, arming the drone, subscribing to mission progress updates, starting the mission, waiting for the mission to finish, returning to launch, and exiting the program.

The `THREAD MainThread` represents the main thread of the program, which executes the `SUBPROGRAM MAIN` periodically with a frequency of 1 Hz.

The `PROCESS SYSTEM.initialization` initializes the DroneApp system and defines the connections between the features. The `MAIN_THREAD` property is set to the `MainThread` thread.

Please note that this AADL model provides a high-level representation of the architecture and may require further refinement and specification to accurately capture the behaviors and interactions of the components.
