Unfortunately, AADL does not have direct support for modeling software architecture with detailed code syntax. AADL focuses more on system architecture and interaction between components at a higher level.

However, the information provided in the description can still be used to create an AADL model that captures the architecture of the drone application. The model can include the components, interfaces, and connections described.

Here is a simplified example of how the AADL model can be structured:

```
package Drone_Application
public
  with SEI;
  with Units;

  system Drone_Application_System
  public
    abstract system Joystick
    features
      ...
      connect: in event port;
      disconnect: out event port;
      button_values: out data port Integer;
      axis_values: out data port Real;
    end Joystick;    

    abstract system Drone
    features
      ...
      move: in event port;
      button_values: in data port Integer;
      axis_values: in data port Real;
    end Drone;
    
  end Drone_Application_System;
  
  system implementation Drone_Application_Behavior
  public
    subcomponents
      joystick: instance Joystick.Behavior;
      drone: instance Drone.Behavior;
    connections
      joystick.connect -> drone_move;
      joystick.disconnect -> drone_move;
      joystick.button_values -> drone.button_values;
      joystick.axis_values -> drone.axis_values;
    end Drone_Application_Behavior;
    
    thread implementation Joystick.Behavior
    subcomponents
      joystick: instance Joystick_Component;
    end Joystick.Behavior;
    
    thread implementation Drone.Behavior
    subcomponents
      drone: instance Drone_Component;
    end Drone.Behavior;
  
    data implementation Joystick_Component
    features
      ...
      create: out event port;
      start_poll_loop: out event port;
      stop_poll_loop: out event port;
      set_initial_values: in data port;
      print_values: in event port;
      set_button: in data port;
      set_axis: in data port;
      get_axis: out data port;
    end Joystick_Component;
    
    ...
  
  end Drone_Application_Behavior;

end Drone_Application;
```

This AADL model captures the architecture of the drone application with two main components: Joystick and Drone. Each component has its own features such as connect, disconnect, button_values, and axis_values.

The connections section establishes the connections between the Joystick and Drone components. The joystick.connect event port is connected to the drone_move event port of the Drone component to handle joystick connection events. Similarly, joystick.button_values and joystick.axis_values data ports are connected to the respective data ports of the Drone component to provide button and axis values.

The specific behavior of each component is implemented in separate threads: Joystick.Behavior and Drone.Behavior. The subcomponents section contains the respective instances of the underlying components.

Note that this is a simplified example, and the actual AADL model may include additional components, connections, and features based on the specific requirements of the drone application.

Remember to adapt the AADL model to your specific needs and conventions.
