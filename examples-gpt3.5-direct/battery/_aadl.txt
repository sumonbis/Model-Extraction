Here is an example of an AADL model architecture file for the given drone application code:

```aadl
package DroneApp
public
   with Base_Types, Networking;

-- Define the data types used in the application
data BatteryStatus
features
   capacity : Base_Types.Integer;
   voltage : Base_Types.Integer;
   current : Base_Types.Integer;
   temperature : Base_Types.Integer;
   remaining : Base_Types.Integer;
end BatteryStatus;

-- Define the threads in the system
thread MAVSDKThread
features
   -- Dependency on MAVSDK library
   mavsdk_library : requires BASE_Types;
end MAVSDKThread;

thread SubcribeArmedThread
features
   -- Dependency on Telemetry library
   telemetry_library : requires BASE_Types;
end SubcribeArmedThread;

thread SendBatteryStatusThread
features
   -- Dependency on MavlinkPassthrough library
   mavlink_passthrough_library : requires BASE_Types;
end SendBatteryStatusThread;

thread MainThread
features
   -- Dependency on MAVSDKThread, SubscribeArmedThread, and SendBatteryStatusThread
   mavsdk_thread : requires MAVSDKThread;
   subscribe_armed_thread : requires SubscribeArmedThread;
   send_battery_status_thread : requires SendBatteryStatusThread;
end MainThread;

-- Define the connections between the threads
connection subscribe_armed_connection
from subscribe_armed_thread::telemetry_library.requires
to main_thread::mavsdk_thread.provides;

connection send_battery_status_connection
from send_battery_status_thread::mavlink_passthrough_library.requires
to main_thread::mavsdk_thread.provides;

connection battery_status_connection
from main_thread::subscribe_armed_thread.provides
to main_thread::send_battery_status_thread.provides;

system DroneSystem
end DroneSystem;
```

Please note that the AADL model architecture file provided is an example and may need to be modified or extended to fit your specific requirements and the actual implementation of the application code.
