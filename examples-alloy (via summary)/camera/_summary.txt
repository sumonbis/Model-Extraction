Explanation of the code syntax:

- Header files:
  - `#include <mavsdk/mavsdk.h>`: Includes the library provided by MAVSDK, which allows communication with the drone.
  - `#include <mavsdk/plugins/camera/camera.h>`: Includes the library for accessing and controlling the drone's camera.
  - `#include <mavsdk/plugins/telemetry/telemetry.h>`: Includes the library for retrieving telemetry information from the drone.

- Namespaces:
  - `using namespace mavsdk;`: Brings the `mavsdk` namespace into scope for easier access to MAVSDK classes and functions.
  - `using std::chrono::seconds;`: Brings the `seconds` class from the `chrono` namespace into scope for time-related operations.
  - `using std::this_thread::sleep_for;`: Brings the `sleep_for` function from the `this_thread` namespace into scope for pausing the program execution.

- `main` function:
  - The entry point of the program.
  - Reads the connection URL from the command line arguments.
  - Creates an instance of `Mavsdk` to communicate with the drone.
  - Attempts to add a connection with the specified URL.
  - Waits for a system with a camera to be discovered.
  - Once a camera is discovered, sets it as the system to use.
  - Instantiates the `Telemetry` and `Camera` plugins.
  - Sets the camera mode to photo mode.
  - Subscribes to capture information events from the camera.
  - Takes a photo.
  - Pauses the program for 2 seconds.

- `usage` function:
  - Prints the usage instructions for the program.

- `ConnectionResult`:
  - Represents the result of a connection attempt.

- `Telemetry` class:
  - Provides access to telemetry information from the drone.

- `Camera` class:
  - Provides access to the drone's camera and its functions.
  - `Camera::Mode` enum:
    - Represents the different modes of the camera (e.g., photo, video, etc.).
  - `Camera::Result` enum:
    - Represents the result of a camera operation (e.g., success, failure, etc.).
  - `Camera::CaptureInfo` struct:
    - Contains information about a captured image (e.g., file URL).
