Here is the Alloy model for the given drone application source code:

```alloy
sig Component {}

one sig Sender, MavlinkPassthrough, AttitudeData, Tester extends Component {}

pred connected(c1: Component, c2: Component) {
  c1 != c2
}

pred usage(Sender, MavlinkPassthrough)
pred usage(Sender, AttitudeData)
pred usage(Tester, AttitudeData)

fact {
  connected[Sender, MavlinkPassthrough]
  connected[Sender, AttitudeData]
  connected[Tester, AttitudeData]

  usage[Sender, MavlinkPassthrough]
  usage[Sender, AttitudeData]
  usage[Tester, AttitudeData]
}
```

This Alloy model defines the four components Sender, MavlinkPassthrough, AttitudeData, and Tester. The `connected` predicate ensures that these components are connected in the architecture. The `usage` predicate defines which components are used by other components.

The `fact` block enforces the connections and usages based on the provided description.

Please note that this Alloy model provides a high-level representation of the architecture and connections between components. It does not describe the detailed class structure and function calls within each component.
