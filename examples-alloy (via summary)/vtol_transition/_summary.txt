Components:
1. Mavsdk: Represents the main interface to the MAVSDK library. It is responsible for managing connections to the drone systems.
2. Main: The main function that acts as the entry point of the application code.
3. Vehicle: The vehicle control component that contains the application logic for commanding the drone.
4. Telemetry: The telemetry plugin that provides access to the drone's telemetry information such as position, altitude, and health status.
5. Action: The action plugin that provides control over the drone's actions such as arming, takeoff, land, goto location, etc.
6. System: Represents a specific drone system. It is discovered by the Mavsdk and contains information and interfaces related to that system.
7. Connection: Represents the connection to the drone system.

Interfaces and Connections:
1. The Main component initializes the Mavsdk instance and establishes a connection with the drone system using the provided connection URL.
2. The Main component gets a reference to the connected system using the get_system() function.
3. The Main component instantiations the Telemetry and Action plugins using the connected system.
4. The Telemetry plugin sets the rate for receiving position updates from the drone and subscribes to the position update events.
5. The Action plugin is used to arm the drone, takeoff, transition to fixed-wing mode, goto a specific location, transition back to multicopter mode, and land the drone.
6. The Main component waits for the vehicle to be ready to arm by continuously checking the health status using the telemetry plugin.
7. The get_system() function waits for the system discovery event and returns the discovered system to the Main component.

Explanation of Code Syntax:
- #include: Used to include the necessary header files for using the MAVSDK library and other standard libraries.
- using: Using namespace declarations to simplify the usage of specific namespaces in the code.
- std::this_thread::sleep_for: Sleeping the current thread for a specified duration.
- std::chrono::seconds: Represents a duration in seconds.
- std::future: Represents a result that may not be available yet.
- std::promise: Used to set a value or an exception in a future.
- std::cerr: Standard error stream for error output.
- std::cout: Standard output stream for regular output.
- Mavsdk: Represents the main interface to the MAVSDK library. It is initialized and used to establish a connection with the drone system.
- Mavsdk::add_any_connection: Adds a new connection using the provided connection URL.
- std::shared_ptr<System>: Shared pointer to a System object representing a drone system.
- Mavsdk::subscribe_on_new_system: Subscribes to the event triggered when a new system is discovered.
- System::has_autopilot: Checks if the system has an autopilot.
- Mavsdk::systems: Returns a list of all discovered systems.
- Telemetry: Represents the telemetry plugin and provides access to the drone's telemetry information.
- Action: Represents the action plugin and provides control over the drone's actions.
- Telemetry::set_rate_position: Sets the update rate for receiving position updates from the drone.
- Telemetry::subscribe_position: Subscribes to the position update events and provides a callback function to handle the received positions.
- Telemetry::Position: Represents the position information of the drone.
- Telemetry::health_all_ok: Checks if the drone's health status is all OK.
- Action::arm: Arms the drone.
- Action::takeoff: Initiates the takeoff sequence for the drone.
- Action::transition_to_fixedwing: Transitions the drone to fixed-wing mode.
- Action::goto_location: Sends the drone to a specified location with latitude and longitude.
- Action::transition_to_multicopter: Transitions the drone back to multicopter mode.
- Action::land: Lands the drone.
- Telemetry::armed: Checks if the drone is armed.
- NAN: Represents a "Not a Number" value for unset parameters.
