The Alloy model for the given drone application code can be represented as follows:

```alloy
module DroneApp

// Declare signatures for different classes
sig Main {}
sig Telemetry {}
sig Action {}
sig MissionRaw {}
sig System {}

// Composition relationships
sig complete_mission {
    mavsdk: Main,
    telemetry: Telemetry,
    action: Action,
    mission_raw: MissionRaw,
    system: System
}

// Relationships between classes
fact {
    // Main creates Mavsdk, adds connections, waits for system discovery, and spawns threads for each system
    Main in complete_mission.mavsdk

    // Each complete_mission function has instances of Telemetry, Action, and MissionRaw
    complete_mission.telemetry in complete_mission.action + complete_mission.mission_raw
    complete_mission.action in complete_mission.telemetry + complete_mission.mission_raw
    complete_mission.mission_raw in complete_mission.telemetry + complete_mission.action

    // Each complete_mission function has an instance of System
    complete_mission.system in System

    // Telemetry uses callbacks to subscribe to position updates and health changes
    complete_mission.telemetry in subscribe_position
    complete_mission.telemetry in health_all_ok
    complete_mission.telemetry in armed

    // MissionRaw imports mission items from QGroundControl and uploads them to the drone
    complete_mission.mission_raw in import_qgroundcontrol_mission

    // Each system has a system ID
    System has one systemId
}

pred show {}

run show for 10
```

In the Alloy model, we declare signatures for different classes such as `Main`, `Telemetry`, `Action`, `MissionRaw`, and `System`. We also define a composition relationship `complete_mission` that represents the instances of these classes being used together in the `complete_mission` function.

The fact block specifies the relationships between classes. It ensures that the `Main` class is included in `complete_mission.mavsdk`, and each `complete_mission` function has instances of `Telemetry`, `Action`, `MissionRaw`, and `System`. It also specifies that `Telemetry` uses callbacks to subscribe to position updates and health changes, and `MissionRaw` imports mission items from QGroundControl.

The final predicate `show` and the `run` command are used to execute the model and generate instances that satisfy the defined relationships.
