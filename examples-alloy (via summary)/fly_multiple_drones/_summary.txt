                      +- get_system_id()

```

Explanation of code syntax and functionality:

- The `main()` function creates an instance of the Mavsdk and adds connections specified as command line arguments. It then waits for system discovery and spawns threads for each system to call the `complete_mission()` function.
- The `complete_mission()` function takes a mission plan and a shared pointer to a system as input. It creates instances of Telemetry, Action, and MissionRaw for each system to perform telemetry data collection, command actions, and mission management, respectively.
- Telemetry allows monitoring of the drone's position, health, and arming status. It uses callbacks to subscribe to position updates and health changes.
- Action allows arming the drone.
- MissionRaw allows importing mission items from a QGroundControl plan, uploading the mission to the drone, starting the mission, and receiving mission progress updates.
- The system class provides access to system-specific information such as the system ID.
