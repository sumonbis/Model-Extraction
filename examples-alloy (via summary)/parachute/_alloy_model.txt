Unfortunately, Alloy does not directly support UML notation for modeling software architecture. Alloy is a formal modeling language primarily focused on specifying and analyzing the structural properties of software systems.

However, I can help you create an Alloy model representing the system's structural components and their relationships. The Alloy model will focus on representing the static structure of the code rather than the dynamic behavior captured in the UML diagram.

Let's start by defining the basic signatures for the components:

```
sig Main {}

sig MavsdkLibrary {}

sig ParachutePlugin {}

sig MavlinkPassthroughPlugin {}

sig AutopilotSystem {}

sig MAVLinkMessages {}

```

We can represent the connections between the components using the following relations:

```
fact ConnectionsDefinition {
  MavsdkLibrary in Main
  ParachutePlugin in Main
  MavlinkPassthroughPlugin in Main
  AutopilotSystem in Main
}

```

To capture the relationship between the ParachutePlugin and the MAVLinkMessages, we can introduce a relation `processedMessages`:

```
sig MAVLinkMessage {
  belongsTo: ParachutePlugin
}

fact ParachuteToMessages {
  ParachutePlugin.processedMessages = MAVLinkMessages
}

```

Note that `ParachutePlugin.processedMessages` represents the set of MAVLinkMessages processed by the ParachutePlugin.

Finally, we can model the main function using a predicate `mainFunction`:

```
pred mainFunction[m: Main, mavsdk: MavsdkLibrary, parachute: ParachutePlugin, mavlink: MavlinkPassthroughPlugin, autopilot: AutopilotSystem] {
  mavsdk in m
  parachute in m
  mavlink in m
  autopilot in m
  autopilot in parachute
}

run mainFunction for 1
```

This Alloy model captures the structural aspects of the system, representing the components and their relationships. However, it does not capture the dynamic behavior of the code.

Note that Alloy models can be extended further to specify additional properties or constraints. This basic model can serve as a starting point to refine and add more details as needed.
