The UML architecture description for the given drone application code can be represented as follows:

```plantuml

    {abstract} +systems(): std::vector<std::shared_ptr<System>>

    {abstract} +wait() const
    {abstract} +wait_until_discover(system_uuid: uint64_t, timeout_ms: int = -1)
}

interface System {
    {abstract} +has_camera(): bool
}

interface Camera {

    {abstract} +possible_setting_options(): std::vector<SettingOption>

Explanation of the code syntax:

- The code is written in C++ language.
- The code includes multiple C++ header files from the `mavsdk` library, such as `<mavsdk/mavsdk.h>`, `<mavsdk/plugins/camera/camera.h>`, and `<mavsdk/plugins/telemetry/telemetry.h>`. These headers provide the necessary classes and interfaces to interact with the drone's camera and telemetry data.
- The code defines a namespace `mavsdk` to use classes and functions from the `mavsdk` library without specifying the namespace every time.
- The code includes other C++ standard library headers like `<chrono>`, `<cstdint>`, `<iostream>`, `<future>`, `<memory>`, `<stdexcept>`, `<string>`, and `<thread>` to use various functionalities and data types.
- The code uses the `using` directive to make names from the `mavsdk` and `std::chrono` namespaces directly accessible without specifying the namespace.
- The code defines a function `usage` to display the usage of the application, which takes a string `bin_name` as an argument.
- The code defines a `struct` named `CurrentSettings`, which has a mutable `std::mutex` member to synchronize access to the `settings` vector.
- The code defines an enumeration `Input` to represent different input options for the application.
- The code defines several functions to perform operations on the drone camera and handle user input.
- The code defines a `main` function as the entry point of the program, which takes command-line arguments `argc` and `argv`.
- The `main` function initializes the `mavsdk` object, connects to the drone using the provided connection URL, and waits for the discovery of a system with a camera.
- Once the camera system is discovered, the program instantiates the `telemetry` and `camera` objects to interact with the drone's telemetry and camera functionalities.
- The program creates a `CurrentSettings` object to cache and manage the current camera settings.
- The program enters a loop in which it prompts the user for different input options and performs the corresponding actions based on the selected option.
- The program uses callbacks and multi-threading to update and display the current camera settings.
- The program continues running until the user selects the "Quit" option.
- The `main` function returns 0 to indicate successful execution of the program.

Note: The above description provides a simplified overview of the architecture based on the code provided. Additional implementation details and interactions with other components may exist but are not visible from the given code snippet.
