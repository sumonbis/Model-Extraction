Alloy is a declarative modeling language that is used to specify and analyze software and system architectures. Here is an Alloy model that captures the structural aspects of the given drone application source code:

    connection: one Connection

    shell.system = system

}

pred userExitCommand(program: Program, shell: one Shell, exitCommand: one Command){
    -- User enters "exit" command to exit the interactive shell
    exitCommand in shell.commandQueue

-- Fact declarations

    System.connection in AnyConnection
    MavsdkConnection in System.connection
}

    -- Shell is connected to the System and has 1 relation
    Shell.system in System
    Shell in System.connection

    one stdStr: Class | stdStr.name = "std::string"

    -- std::cin and std::cout are defined
    let ioStream = System.objects & Class,
        cin = ioStream & Field,
        cout = ioStream & Field{
        cin.name = "std::cin" and
        cout.name = "std::cout"
    }
}

-- Helper function declarations

fun program: Program{
    -- Contains all the classes, objects, and method calls in the program
    ...
}

fun FunctionCall: set Method{
    -- Contains all the function calls in the program
    ...
}
```

Note that the Alloy model captures the structural aspects of the given code and defines predicates and facts to represent the behavior. The exact implementation of the predicates and facts depends on your specific needs and the details of the code. You can extend and modify the model as per your requirements.
