Here is an example of an AADL model architecture (.aadl) for the given drone application code:

```aadl
-------------------------------------
-- DroneApp Architecture Definition --
-------------------------------------

-- Import necessary AADL packages
with AADL;

-- Define the namespace for the drone application architecture
package DroneApp
public
   with SEI;

   -- Define the system type for the drone application
   system DroneApp_System
      properties
         with Deployment::Actual_Processor_Binding => Name;
      end properties;

      -- Define the subcomponents of the drone application system
      subcomponents
         DroneSDK : process MAVSDK_Processor;
      end subcomponents;

      -- Define the connection between subcomponents
      connectionset MyConnectionSet
         connections
            DroneSDK.DeploymentConnection -> Transponder.Subscription;
            DroneSDK.SubscriptionConnection -> Transponder.Subscription;
         end connections;
      end connectionset;
   end DroneApp_System;

   -- Define the processor type for the drone application
   process type MAVSDK_Processor
      features
         Deployment : out SEI::String_Type;
      end features;

      -- Define the subcomponents of the MAVSDK processor
      subcomponents
         Transponder : process Transponder_Processor;
      end subcomponents;

      -- Define the connection between subcomponents
      connectionset DeploymentConnectionSet
         connections
            Transponder.DeploymentConnection -> Deployment;
         end connections;
      end connectionset;
   end MAVSDK_Processor;

   -- Define the processor type for the Transponder
   process type Transponder_Processor
      features
         DeploymentConnection : out SEI::String_Type;
         Subscription : in SEI::String_Type;
      end features;

      -- Define the subprograms of the Transponder processor
      subprograms
         Main : subprogram MainEntry;
      end subprograms;
   end Transponder_Processor;

   -- Define the subprogram MainEntry for the Transponder processor
   subprogram subprogram MainEntry
      properties
         Compute_Execution_Time => 5 ms;
      end properties;
   end MainEntry;
end DroneApp;
```

Please note that this AADL model is a simplified representation and may require additional components, features, and connections depending on the overall system architecture and requirements.
